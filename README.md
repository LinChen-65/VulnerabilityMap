# VulnerabilityMap

## Introduction
This repository holds the dataset for our paper: *VulnerabilityMap: An Open Framework for Mapping Vulnerability among Urban Disadvantaged Populations in the United States*.

## File Structure


## Field Description
We provide a comprehensive dataset for the whole United States with all features in `all_data.csv`, and provide basic information of the columns below.
| Column Name 	| Description 	| Example 	|
|-------------	|-------------	|---------	|
| Level-1 Category   | Top category of the dataset.      | Disadvantage Indices, Vulnerability Outcomes  |
| Level-2 Category   | Second category of the dataset.     | Demographic Disadvantage, Neighborhood Disadvantage, Mobility Disadvantage, Social Disadvantage, Vulnerability to Shocks, Vulnerability to Stresses 	|
| Feature            | Specific feature.     | % Non-Hispanic White Population        	|
| Time Period        | The period of time of raw data collection.     | 2009-2021          |
| Source             | The source of raw data.     | American Community Servey         | 

Besides, we also provide separate files for offline CBG-POI bipartite mobility patterns in each Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) as defined by the United States Census Bureau, each in a separate folder named after the CBSAâ€™s official title.
For each CBSA in each year, we maintain one file `combined_dict_[cbsa code]_[year].pkl.gz` to record its CBG-POI bipartite mobility patterns. Each file is arranged in a dictionary form, with the following keys and values:
| Key 	| Value Meaning	|
|-------------	|-------------	|
| cbg_list | List of CBG FIPS codes contained in this CBSA, corresponding to the order of rows in cbg2poi_od. |
| poi_list | List of CBG placekeys contained in this CBSA, corresponding to the order of columns in cbg2poi_od. |
| cbg2poi_od | A numpy array with the shape (len(cbg_list), len(poi_list)), recording total visits from each CBG to each POI. |
