## Field Description
We provide processed datasets of disadvantage features and vulnerability outcomes for census block groups in the United States. The features contained in each category and corresponding information of the raw datasources are as follows:
![](images/summary_table_1.png)
![](images/summary_table_2.png)
![](images/summary_table_3.png)
![](images/summary_table_4.png)
Note that because both Stress (Level 2) and Stress (Level 3) contain visitation related features, we include the complete file `facility_visitation_df` in both `stress_level_2` and `stress_level_3` directories.

Besides, we also provide separate files for offline CBG-POI bipartite mobility patterns in each Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) as defined by the United States Census Bureau, each in a separate folder named after the CBSA’s official title.
For each CBSA in each year, we maintain one file `combined_dict_[cbsa code]_[year].pkl.gz` to record its CBG-POI bipartite mobility patterns. Each file is arranged in a dictionary form, with the following keys and values:
| Key 	| Value Meaning	|
|-------------	|-------------	|
| cbg_list | List of CBG FIPS codes contained in this CBSA, corresponding to the order of rows in cbg2poi_od. |
| poi_list | List of CBG placekeys contained in this CBSA, corresponding to the order of columns in cbg2poi_od. |
| cbg2poi_od | A numpy array with the shape (len(cbg_list), len(poi_list)), recording total visits from each CBG to each POI. |
